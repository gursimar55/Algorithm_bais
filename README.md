# Algorithm_bais

The objective is to assess the impact of algorithm bias on machine learning algorithms trained with imbalanced data. 
1. Load the Breast Cancer dataset using the code in AlgorithmBiasCore and assess the bias of classifiers trained on this dataset, i.e. are classifiers biased towards the majority class? Consider k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in your assessment. 
2. Test for bias using hold-out testing and cross-validation. 
3. Propose a strategy to rectify this bias. Evaluate the effect of this strategy in terms of classification bias and overall accuracy.  
4. Test the impact of this strategy on another dataset of your choice.
